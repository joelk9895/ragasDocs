# Ragas Docs

##Welcome to the Ragas Docs!

This site is dedicated to providing comprehensive documentation for the Ragas project. Here, you'll find detailed information about the project, its features, and how to get the most out of it.

Now the main object here is [`School`](references.md#ragasdocs.module1.School) which is a dataclass.

```python
from ragasdocs import School

school = School()
```

=== "C"

    ``` c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
      printf("Hello world!\n");
      return 0;
    }
    ```

=== "C++"

    ``` c++
    #include <iostream>

    int main(void) {
      std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
      return 0;
    }
    ```

##After this there will be another code block
=== "C"

    ``` c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
      printf("Hello world!\n");
      return 0;
    }
    ```

=== "C++"

    ``` c++
    #include <iostream>

    int main(void) {
      std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
      return 0;
    }
